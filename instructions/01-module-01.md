## Explore Cognitive Services

Azure Cognitive Services encapsulate common AI functionality that can be categorized into four main pillars: vision, speech, language, and decision services. In this exercise you will take a look at one of the decision services to get a general sense of how to provision and use a cognitive services resource in a software application.

The specific cognitive service you'll explore in this exercise is *Anomaly Detector*. Anomaly Detector is used to analyze data values over time, and to detect any unusual values that might indicate a problem or an issue for further investigation. For example, a sensor in a temperature-controlled storage facility might monitor the temperature every minute and log the measured values. You can use the Anomaly Detector service to analyze the logged temperature values and flag any that fall significantly outside of the normal range of expected temperatures.

This exercise is part of a module on Microsoft Learn, and requires an Azure subscription. You should use the Azure subscription provided as part of the class.

> **Note**: The goal of this exercise is to get a general sense of how cognitive services are provisioned and used. Anomaly Detector is used as an example, but you are not expected to gain a comprehensive knowledge of anomaly detection in this exercise!
